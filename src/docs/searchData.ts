    content: `Welcome to DockerPull. A modern container image management platform for pulling, storing, and distributing Docker images across multiple platforms with ease.
Why DockerPull? DockerPull simplifies the process of managing container images from multiple registries. Whether you are working with Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Quay, or Google Container Registry, DockerPull provides a unified interface to handle all your image operations.
Multi-Registry Support. Pull from Docker Hub, GHCR, Quay, GCR, and more with unified management.
Multi-Platform Images. Handle amd64 and arm64 architectures automatically for seamless deployment.
Auto Export. Configure automatic export paths to streamline your CI/CD pipeline.
Webhook Notifications. Get real-time notifications when images are pulled or failures occur.
Architecture Overview. DockerPull uses a pull-based architecture that ensures images are always verified before export. The system works by connecting to your configured registries, pulling the requested images, and optionally exporting them to your specified directory.
Pro Tip. DockerPull uses a pull-based architecture, ensuring images are always verified before export. This provides an additional layer of security and validation.`

    content: `Quick Start. Get up and running with DockerPull in under 5 minutes. Follow these simple steps to start managing your container images.
Step 1. Access the Dashboard. After logging in, you will see the Overview page displaying real-time statistics about your image operations.
Step 2. Add Your First Image. Navigate to the Images page and click the Add button. Enter the full image name like nginx:latest. Select target platforms amd64, arm64, or both. Enable auto-export if needed. Click Add to start pulling.
Step 3. Monitor Progress. Image status updates in real-time. You can track the progress of your pulls and see when they complete. Status types: Pending, Pulling, Success, Failed.
Step 4. Export Images. Once successfully pulled, click the Download button to export the image as a tar file. The file will be saved to your configured export path.
Pro Tip. Use the batch mode to add multiple images at once — perfect for initial setup! Duplicates are automatically skipped.
Common Image Formats. Docker Hub: nginx:latest or docker.io/library/nginx:latest. GitHub Container Registry: ghcr.io/owner/repo:v1.0. Quay.io: quay.io/org/image:tag. Alibaba ACR: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/myapp:v1. AWS ECR Public: public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx:latest. Google GAR: us-docker.pkg.dev/project/repo/image:tag`

    content: `Installation. Deploy DockerPull using Docker for easy setup and management.
Docker Compose Recommended. The easiest way to get started with DockerPull is using Docker Compose. This method handles all the configuration and dependencies automatically.
Environment Variables. SECRET_KEY: Secret key for session encryption Required. ADMIN_PASSWORD: Initial admin password Required. EXPORT_PATH: Default export directory Optional default /app/exports. PORT: Server port Optional default 8080.
Directory Structure. /app/data/ Database and configuration. /app/exports/ Exported image tar files. /app/logs/ Application logs.
Docker Run Alternative. If you prefer not to use Docker Compose, you can run DockerPull directly with docker run command.
Accessing the Application. Once running, access the DockerPull web interface at http://localhost:8080. Log in with the admin credentials you configured.`

    content: `Image Management. Learn how to add, monitor, and manage container images across multiple registries and platforms.
Adding Images. DockerPull supports multiple image formats from various container registries. You can add images individually or in batch mode.
Supported Formats. Docker Hub nginx:latest Optional auth. GitHub Container Registry ghcr.io/owner/repo:v1.0 Recommended auth. Quay.io quay.io/org/image:tag For private. Alibaba ACR registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com. AWS ECR Public public.ecr.aws. AWS ECR Private *.amazonaws.com Required auth. Google Artifact Registry *.pkg.dev.
Batch Mode. Add multiple images at once by toggling batch mode. Enter one image per line. Duplicates are automatically skipped with a summary of added vs skipped items.
Status Types. Pending: Queued for processing. Pulling: Currently downloading. Success: Successfully pulled. Failed: Pull failed.
Platform Selection. linux/amd64 Standard x86_64 architecture. linux/arm64 ARM64 architecture for Apple Silicon AWS Graviton.
Managing Images. Pull: Manually trigger a pull. Export: Download the image as a tar file. Delete: Remove the image from DockerPull. View Logs: Check detailed pull logs.
Auto-Export. Enable auto-export when adding an image to automatically export it after a successful pull.`

Supported Platforms. linux/amd64 x86_64 architecture for standard servers VMs and cloud instances. linux/arm64 ARM64 for Apple Silicon M1/M2 AWS Graviton Raspberry Pi.
How It Works. Step 1: Select Platforms. Choose target platforms when adding an image. Step 2: Registry Query. DockerPull queries the registry for available platforms. Step 3: Parallel Pulls. Each platform creates a separate pull task. Step 4: Individual Export. Each platform is exported as a separate tar file.
Platform Detection. DockerPull can check which platforms are available for an image before pulling using the API check-platforms endpoint.
File Naming Convention. Format: {name}_{tag}_{platform}.tar. Examples: nginx_latest_linux-amd64.tar, nginx_latest_linux-arm64.tar.
Use Cases. Development Teams: Support both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Hybrid Infrastructure: Mix of x86_64 and ARM servers. Cost Optimization: Use cheaper ARM instances. Edge Deployments: Raspberry Pi and ARM edge devices.`

    content: `Auto Export. Automatically export pulled images to a specified directory. Streamline your CI/CD pipeline with hands-free exports.
How It Works. Auto Export automatically saves successfully pulled images to your configured export directory, eliminating the need for manual downloads.
Enable Auto Export. Toggle Auto Export when adding an image. This can also be set as the default in Settings.
Configure Export Path. Set your default export path in Settings. Make sure DockerPull has write permissions to this directory.
Automatic Export. Images export automatically after successful pull. Check the Export Status column for confirmation.
File Naming Convention. {name}_{tag}_{platform}.tar. Registry prefixes like ghcr.io or quay.io are sanitized for filesystem compatibility.
Export Status. No export configured. Pending: Waiting for pull to complete. Exported: Successfully exported to path. Failed: Export failed check permissions.
Volume Mounting. When using Docker, mount your export directory as a volume for persistence.`

Registry-Specific Configuration. Docker Hub: Create token at hub.docker.com/settings/security. GitHub: Create token at github.com/settings/tokens with read:packages scope. Quay.io: Create robot account. Alibaba: Use Alibaba Cloud account. AWS ECR: IAM user with ecr:GetAuthorizationToken. Google GAR: Service account with Artifact Registry Reader role.
Rate Limits. Docker Hub: 100 pulls/6hrs anonymous, 200 authenticated. GitHub: 5000 requests/hr authenticated. Quay.io: Unlimited public, based on plan private.
Best Practices. Use dedicated tokens with minimal permissions. Read-only access only. Regular rotation every 90 days. Monitor usage in audit logs. Store securely.
Troubleshooting. Authentication Failed: Verify token not expired, check permissions, ensure correct username format. Rate Limit Errors: Use authenticated pulls, upgrade plan, space out pulls.`
